# READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!
You will need to download the following:
 - Github (just need to make an account so you can access my code)
 - Anacondas: This is a Python package that contains all the necessary programs to run the code. Link is below
 - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
 The code you need is the v2 version (should be at the top of my page)
 In the code you'll see '#' which means you should read it before doing anything
 There are lines of code in there that are in reference to pathways on MY computer. You'll need to edit these yourself (E.G. the name of the file you want the program to analyze)
 This code is set up to analyze CSV files. This is important because if you try to have it analyze a XL file it won't work.
