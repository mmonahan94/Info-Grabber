# READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!
You will need to download the following:
 - Github (just need to make an account so you can access my code)
 - Anacondas: This is a Python package that contains all the necessary programs to run the code. Link is below
 - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

**UPDATE**
Use the Final_v2 version as it now organizes the columns 

In the code you'll see '#' which means you should read it before doing anything
There are lines of code in there that are in reference to pathways on MY computer. You'll need to edit these yourself (E.G. the name of the file you want the program to analyze)
This code is set up to analyze CSV files. 
 
After you've downloaded the Zip containing the code open up Anaconda Navigator then open up Jupyter (should be the 3rd open)
From there you should be able to upload a file. Upload the Final_v2 version of the code and try to run it.
If everything works out you should be able to follow the instructions provided in the code and generate a report for yourself

If you have any issues, give me a call :D
